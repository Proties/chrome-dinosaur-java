#CHROME DINOSAUR GAME

I recreated the Google Chrome dinosaur game just for funâ€”and I have to say, Iâ€™m pretty happy with how it turned out! ðŸ¦–âœ¨ Built with Java, this version keeps things simple, featuring a score counter and the classic jump mechanic.

But Iâ€™m not stopping there! Next up, Iâ€™ll be adding a duck and double jump feature to crank up the challenge. Who knows? This might even evolve into a whole new game while keeping the same core mechanics. Stay tunedâ€”this dinoâ€™s got more tricks up its sleeve! ðŸš€ðŸŽ®

Here is the youtube video that got me started:
